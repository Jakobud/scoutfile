# Style Guide

This project uses [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to enforce code style in addition
to valid Javascript syntax:

```
grunt eslint
```

There is also an [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file to help your
editor follow along.

Code style will be checked using ESLint before each commit.

When in doubt:

- All code should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people
contributed.
- Contributions should follow existing style, regardless of the contributor's
personal style preferences.
- Style should be enforced programmatically whenever possible.
