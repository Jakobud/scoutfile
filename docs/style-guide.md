# Style Guide

This project uses [JSCS](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs) to enforce code style:

`grunt jscs`

There is also an [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file to help your editor follow along.

Code style will be checked using JSCS before each commit.

When in doubt:

- All code should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.
- Contributions should follow existing style, regardless of the contributor's personal style preferences.
- Style should be enforced programmatically whenever possible.
